#Experiment 5: Designing	a	Counter

##Objective:

The objective is to learn how counters, simulating using modelling and testbenches instead of directly programming to the board. We had to create an 8 bit counter.

##Results

We implemented the provided 8 bit counter and used modelsim to analyse its behaviour. We created a test bench to artifically provide commands to the counter. Once we analysed the waveform, we can see that counter was working as expected.

It is useful to use a testbench and modelsim instead of directly programming as it saves times on compilation and allows you to error handle more effectively.
