#Experiment 12: Designing	and	testing	a	sinewave table in ROM

##Objective:

The objective was to produce a ROM to store values sine values and then use the switches to display the value at a certain address using the 7 segment display.

##Results

We created the ROM and populated its contents with the magnitude and phase of a single cycle of sine wave function. We used a Matlab for ROM initialization. We tested our designed display below, and it worked as we expected. Displaying the correct sine values corressponding to the input.
