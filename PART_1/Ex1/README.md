#Experiment 1: Schematic Capture Using Quartus II - 7-Segment Display

##Objective:

To use the switches as a 4 bit binary input which is reflected as hexadecimal on a 7 segment display. This must be done using schematic diagrams. Therefore you must create a binary to hex converter.

##Results

We downloaded the partially completed schematic design from online for the 7 segment decoder. All the inputs and outputs blocks were created except the block used for out[4] - output of the 4th part of 7-segment display. We created schematic block needed to produce out[4] which happened to be **/IN3 AND IN0 COMPLETE THIS PART MOHAMMED**.

We then compiled the designed, assigned the pins and programmed the FPGA. The device worked as expect, fliping the switches in binary produces a HEX number from 0-F.

###Timing Analyser & Resources
We looked at the timing for the design, comparing 4 different models. "Slow 1100mV 0C Model", **COMPLETE THIS SHIT**
As you can see blah blah

The designed used very little resources at only 4 out of 32070 ALM and 11 out of 457 pins.
