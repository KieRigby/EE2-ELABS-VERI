#Experiment 2: 10-bit	 binary	 switch	 values	 on	 three	 7-segment displays

##Objective:

An extension of Exercise 2 where instead of using one LCD display we must instead use 3 LCD screens to display in HEX the 10 bit binary input through the use of switches.

##Results

This turned out to be extremely to extend the inputs. Each LCD screen can display from 0-16 so upto 4 binary bits. Therefore the first two LCD screens used bits 0-3 and 4-7. The last LCD screen used two bits 8-9 and therefore the expected display when all switches are turned on is 3FF. Once the projected was compiled and tested, our expected result appeared.
